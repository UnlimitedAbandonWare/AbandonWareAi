1) Restored / implemented math stubs that had traces in code, guided by resume specs:
   - Weighted Power Mean combiner:
       * Implemented in com.abandonwareai.fusion.WeightedPowerMean (and gap15 stub)
       * Formula: generalized mean with p, includes weighted geometric at p≈0.
   - MP-Law normalizer (heuristic):
       * Implemented in com.abandonwareai.fusion.MpLawNormalizer (and gap15 stub)
       * Robust median/MAD + MP bulk-edge soft clipping + [0,1] scaling.
   - Bode-like sensitivity clamp:
       * Implemented in com.abandonwareai.fusion.BodeClamp
       * Limits linear gain by decibel cap (20*log10), maps back to linear.
   - Score calibrator fallback:
       * Implemented in com.abandonwareai.fusion.ScoreCalibrator
       * Stateless logistic squashing when no fitted calibrator is present.

2) Planner Nexus minimal hookup:
   - com.abandonwareai.planner.PlannerNexus.applyPlan delegates to
     KAllocationPolicy and best-effort propagates RRF/calibration knobs
     to a chain context (via reflection) without breaking existing wiring.

3) No changes to existing WeightedRRF / FusionService logic, already present with
   per-source min-max calibrator and canonical-key dedup.

4) Rationale:
   - Targets correspond to '잘려나간 기능 흔적' under extras/gap15-stubs_v1 and
     duplicate empty classes in com.abandonwareai.* packages.
   - Formulae cross-checked with legacy lms sources:
       com.acme.aicore.adapters.ranking.WeightedRrfRanking (RRF),
       com.example.lms.service.rag.fusion.FusionCalibrator (min-max),
       com.example.lms.fusion.WeightedPowerMeanFusion (WPM),
       DeltaProjection/GrandasFusionPipeline (GRA‑NΔ‑AS).
   - All new code is fail-soft and clamps outputs to [0,1] with numerics safety.
