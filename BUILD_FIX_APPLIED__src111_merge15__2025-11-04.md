# Build Fix Applied — src111_merge15 (2025-11-04)

## What changed
1) **Added Spring Boot entrypoint**: `com.example.lms.LmsApplication` under `app/` and set as `springBoot.mainClass`.
2) **Aligned Java toolchain** to **17** for bootRun/runtime compatibility.
3) **Hardened build-error guard script** to sanitize `` and summarize frequent failure patterns into TXT+JSON.
4) **Extended persisted error patterns** with `MAIN_CLASS_NOT_FOUND_bootRun` remediation steps.
5) Sanitized `agent_scaffold/traits/_ko.md` to avoid any literal `` leakage.

## Why
- Addressed `Error: Could not find or load main class com.example.lms.LmsApplication` and
  `Execution failed for task ':bootRun'` patterns observed in build logs.

## How to run (examples)
```bash
./gradlew :app:bootRun
# or package:
./gradlew :app:bootJar
```

## Guard outputs
- Sanitized log: `build/sanitized/build.sanitized.log`
- Summary: `build/sanitized/build.sanitized.summary.txt` and `.summary.json`
