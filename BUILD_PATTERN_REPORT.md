# Build Error Pattern Report — src111_merge15a → src111_merge15

Date: 2025-10-12

## Inputs
- Source: `BUILD_LOG.txt` (scanned), developer-provided Gradle output (pasted in request)

## Extractor
- `cfvm-raw/src/main/java/com/example/lms/cfvm/BuildLogSlotExtractor.java`
  Recognizes patterns: `MISSING_SYMBOL`, `DUPLICATE_CLASS`, `ILLEGAL_START (type)`, `CLASS_EXPECTED`, `PACKAGE_NOT_FOUND`, `OVERRIDE_MISMATCH`.

## Findings
- Current error: `illegal start of expression` → *not matched* by existing `ILLEGAL_START` (which expects `type`).
  Root cause located: missing `}` closing brace after constructor in `QdrantClient.java`.

## Fix
- Inserted a single `}` after `.build();` to close the constructor.
- Re-indented the `search(...)` method.

## Suggestion to improve pattern extractor
- Update `ILLEGAL_START` regex to:
  ```java
  private static final Pattern ILLEGAL_START =
      Pattern.compile("(?i)illegal\s+start\s+of\s+(type|expression)");
  ```
  This will capture both compiler wordings.
