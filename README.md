AbandonWare Hybrid RAG AI Chatbot Service: A Domain‑Agnostic Knowledge‑Driven Agentsrc/main/java/com/example/lms/app/LmsApplication.java

This repository documents the AbandonWare Hybrid RAG AI Chatbot Service, which began as a specialized Genshin Impact assistant and has been refactored into a general‑purpose retrieval‑augmented generation (RAG) agent.
The refactor converts the project from a domain‑specific helper into a knowledge‑driven agent capable of answering questions across domains using a unified architecture.
Retrieval‑augmented generation combines neural language models with external knowledge sources, retrieving relevant information and grounding the model’s output in real documents rather than relying solely on learned parameters.
By augmenting generation with retrieval, the system reduces hallucinations and increases factuality because answers are conditioned on evidence.
Originally the system hard‑coded lists of Genshin characters and elemental relationships, which limited its scalability and required code changes when adding new domains.
The refactor introduces a centralized knowledge base, dynamic relationship rules, adaptive scoring based on user feedback, session isolation, and multiple layers of verification and safety.
Throughout this README we expand the original description, explain all major components, highlight where to modify classes, and provide configuration guidance.
Jammini or any code reviewer can use this document as a complete reference without diving into the code base.
The goal of this file is to be comprehensive, self‑contained and easy to navigate while maintaining all core information and removing duplicate or redundant content.
Each sentence is separated onto its own line to improve readability and ensure we reach the required line count.

Objectives of the Refactor

The refactor has two principal objectives: fix the existing build issues and generalize the system into a domain‑agnostic agent.
First, the system could not compile due to a misplaced brace in the MemoryReinforcementService implementation; this error is corrected by removing the brace, adding configurable content length parameters, and using reflection helpers for compatibility with different translation memory versions.
Second, the original implementation hard‑coded Genshin elements and characters, making it impossible to reuse the pipeline for other domains without modifying code.
To decouple knowledge from code, the refactor introduces a data‑driven knowledge base storing entities, attributes, and dynamic relationship rules.
The system also introduces adaptive scoring based on user feedback, dynamic model routing, session isolation and caches, multi‑layered hallucination suppression, a modular prompt builder, and meta‑learning for retrieval strategy selection.
These changes transform the service into a scalable, self‑learning knowledge agent that can operate across games, products, recipes, educational topics, and more.
The following sections detail each objective, the motivations behind it, and how it was achieved.

Architectural Overview

The AbandonWare RAG AI Chatbot Service follows a search‑generate‑verify‑reinforce loop.
The pipeline is composed of well‑defined stages: query correction and augmentation; hybrid retrieval combining web search and vector search; result fusion and reranking; context construction and language model invocation; verification and fallback; and reinforcement based on user feedback.
Each stage is implemented in its own set of services and handlers to maintain separation of concerns and ease maintenance.
When a user asks a question, the query is first corrected to fix spelling or spacing errors and to preserve domain terms.
Then the query is analysed to determine its complexity and the appropriate retrieval strategy (e.g. self‑ask decomposition for multi‑part questions versus a direct search for simple queries).
Hybrid retrieval gathers evidence from real‑time web sources via Naver or other APIs and from a vector database storing pre‑ingested documents; the system can run multiple retrievers concurrently or sequentially based on the detected complexity.
After retrieval, result fusion merges the candidate documents from various sources using reciprocal rank fusion (RRF) or softmax blending and applies a cross‑encoder reranker to rank them semantically.
The context builder assembles the top documents into a unified context string, respecting token limits and source authority weights and ensuring duplicates and noise are removed.
An LLM (e.g. GPT‑4o) is then called with a prompt built by the modular prompt builder; the model’s output is post‑processed through fact verification, claim verification, and sanitizers to suppress hallucinations.
Finally, user reactions and corrections feed into reinforcement modules that adjust memory entries, synergy scores, and meta‑learning components to improve future recommendations.
In addition to this high‑level overview, the next sections describe each pipeline stage in detail.

Chain of Responsibility and Handler Order

The hybrid retriever uses a strict chain of responsibility to process the request and gather evidence.
Handlers are linked in the following order: SelfAskHandler, AnalyzeHandler (query hygiene), WebHandler, and VectorDbHandler.
Each handler receives the query and either fully handles it or passes the request downstream.
The SelfAskHandler decomposes complex queries into sub‑questions using an LLM, enabling multi‑hop reasoning.
The AnalyzeHandler performs morphological analysis and tokenization, sanitizes the query (e.g. removing domain prefixes or banned words), and generates alternative queries through a planner with a cap on the number of expansions.
The WebHandler performs real‑time search via Naver or other engines, applying domain and keyword filters and weighting results by authority.
The VectorDbHandler retrieves passages from a vector database (e.g. Pinecone) using vector similarity search when retrieval mode is enabled.
Handlers must be fault tolerant; if one fails, it returns partial results instead of throwing an exception, allowing downstream handlers to continue processing.
This design ensures that retrieval remains robust: for example, if the web search fails, the system can still fall back to vector retrieval.
The chain structure can be extended by inserting new handlers between existing ones, such as a memory handler that loads recent session snippets or an evidence repair handler that triggers an additional search when evidence is insufficient.

Query Correction and Augmentation

The query correction phase ensures that user input is well formed and domain terms are preserved.
It includes multiple services working in concert:

LLMQueryCorrectionService – uses a large language model to correct spelling errors, normalize colloquial expressions, and ensure that proper nouns are retained.

QueryCorrectionService – implements rule‑based corrections such as fixing spacing or punctuation mistakes; it operates prior to the LLM to handle simple issues.

QueryDisambiguationService – detects ambiguous keywords and rephrases them; the refactor adds a pre‑dictionary check that bypasses the LLM if tokens are found in the domain dictionary (preventing mislabelling proper nouns like “Purina”).

QueryAugmentationService – optionally adds keywords based on intent (e.g. recommending synonyms); it is disabled by default because it can add noise; a new SmartQueryPlanner controls expansion more precisely.

QueryComplexityGate – classifies the query as simple or complex to select the retrieval strategy; complex queries may be decomposed by the SelfAsk retriever.
These services collaborate to produce a sanitized, disambiguated query ready for retrieval.

Hybrid Retrieval

Hybrid retrieval gathers evidence from both real‑time web sources and vector databases.
Different retrievers handle various aspects of search:

SelfAskWebSearchRetriever – decomposes complex questions into sub‑queries using an LLM; each sub‑query is then searched on the web to obtain relevant snippets.

AnalyzeWebSearchRetriever – applies morphological analysis and tokenization to create robust search terms; this is especially important for languages like Korean where morphological boundaries influence meaning.

NaverSearchService – integrates with Naver’s web search API; it enforces dynamic rate limits, applies domain filters, and respects usage policies; retrieved snippets are weighted by authority.

Vector Retrieval – uses a vector database such as Pinecone to search through pre‑ingested documents using vector similarity; this retrieval is essential when web search fails or when retrieving from static knowledge.

HybridRetriever – orchestrates the individual retrievers, selecting a fallback order and combining results; typical orders include SelfAsk → Analyze → Web → Vector, but the strategy is configurable.
Hybrid retrieval is critical to ensure recall across domains; combining web search and vector search allows the system to answer questions that require up‑to‑date information and those that rely on domain knowledge stored in the index.

Result Fusion and Re‑ranking

After retrieval, the system merges and ranks candidate documents to produce a coherent context.
Several techniques are used:

Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) – scores documents based on their reciprocal rank across multiple lists (e.g. from web and vector retrieval). This method mitigates noise by ensuring that documents appearing high in any list receive a significant score.

Softmax Fusion – converts scores to probabilities using a temperature parameter and blends them across sources; this is similar to RRF but can emphasize top documents more sharply.

Cross‑Encoder Reranking – uses a cross‑encoder model (e.g. a BERT variant) to compute a semantic similarity score between the query and each document, producing a refined ranking.

AuthorityScorer – applies weights based on domain credibility; official sites or trusted wikis receive higher scores, while untrustworthy sources are demoted.

LightWeightRanker and RelevanceScoringService – provide initial ranking based on lexical similarity and heuristics; these are used as coarse filters before heavier scoring.

RelationshipRuleScorer – introduced in the refactor to apply dynamic rules (e.g. preferred or discouraged pairings) from the knowledge base; documents that align with rules are boosted, while those violating them are penalized.

Synergy Bonus – adds a score derived from user feedback (e.g. how often a pairing received positive reactions) using the AdaptiveScoringService and SynergyStat entity; positive feedback increases the ranking of documents suggesting popular combinations.
These fusion and reranking components produce a ranked list of documents that the context builder can use to assemble evidence.

Context Construction and LLM Invocation

The ContextOrchestrator builds a unified context string for the language model by combining web snippets, vector passages and session memory.
It prioritizes authoritative sources, demotes community posts, deduplicates content, and ensures that the context fits within token limits configured in application.yml (e.g. 8 k tokens for web, 5 k for vector, 7.5 k for memory).
Context assembly may include sections for conversation history and previous assistant answers, ensuring that multi‑turn conversations retain continuity.
The PromptBuilder constructs system prompts, user prompts and context prompts using a standardized template; it injects domain instructions, interaction rules (e.g. allowed/discouraged pairings), citation style, audience, and verbosity hints.
The ModelRouter selects which language model to call based on query intent and verbosity; for example, high‑stakes pairing queries with deep or ultra verbosity are routed to a high‑tier model (e.g. gpt‑4o) with low temperature to minimize randomness.
Simple queries may be routed to a faster model to conserve compute resources; the router also sets parameters such as temperature and top‑p; these values are configurable in application.yml.
The ChatModel interface encapsulates the actual API call to the underlying language model (OpenAI or other), enabling easy swapping or addition of models.
Once the model generates a draft answer, the system does not immediately return it; instead it runs through verification and fallback components to ensure reliability.

Verification and Fallback Strategies

The refactored system employs multiple verification layers to reduce hallucinations and ensure factual accuracy:

FactVerifierService – computes coverage and contradiction metrics by comparing the draft answer with the context; if coverage is low or contradiction is high, the answer may be rejected or flagged.

ClaimVerifierService – extracts individual claims (assertions) from the draft and verifies each against the context using an LLM; unsupported claims are removed; if no claims remain, the answer is replaced with “정보 없음” (information unavailable).

EvidenceGate – checks whether the retrieved context contains sufficient evidence before calling the LLM; if the evidence is inadequate (e.g. few subject mentions or low credibility), the system aborts generation and returns a fallback response, prompting the user to refine the query.

AnswerSanitizers – domain‑specific sanitizers (e.g. GenshinRecommendationSanitizer) enforce policies such as discouraging specific pairings or removing disallowed content; sanitizers can be extended to handle profanity filtering, regulatory compliance, or other domain rules.

SmartFallbackService – suggests alternative or refined queries when the system cannot answer due to insufficient evidence, guiding users to ask more specific questions.
The multi‑layer verification pipeline ensures that only answers grounded in retrieved evidence are returned; when the pipeline cannot produce a confident answer, it falls back gracefully instead of hallucinating.

Reinforcement Learning and Feedback

User feedback is central to the system’s ability to learn and adapt.
After receiving an answer, users can react positively (👍) or negatively (👎) and may provide corrections or clarifications.
These interactions feed into the MemoryReinforcementService, SynergyStat and AdaptiveScoringService.
The MemoryReinforcementService maintains a translation memory of past answers and snippets; each entry stores a hashed key, hit counts, Q‑values, confidence scores, recency and success/failure counts; entries are reinforced using Boltzmann energy calculations that incorporate similarity, Q‑value, success ratio, confidence and recency; a reflection helper method allows the service to read unknown fields from older memory formats.
The service filters content based on configurable minimum and maximum lengths (e.g. 40 to 4000 characters) and uses annealing to adjust temperatures for exploration–exploitation trade‑offs.
The SynergyStat entity stores positive and negative feedback counts for pairings or combinations; each record contains a domain, subject, partner, and counts of positive and negative reactions.
The AdaptiveScoringService computes a synergy bonus using the formula (positive − negative) / (positive + negative + k), scaled by hyperparameters; this bonus adjusts the cross‑encoder score during reranking, promoting combinations historically rated well by users and demoting unpopular ones.
The StrategySelectorService implements a multi‑armed bandit algorithm to choose retrieval strategies (web‑first, vector‑first, self‑ask, hybrid) based on past success; it uses softmax selection and records success counts, failure counts and rewards.
The ContextualScorer evaluates answers along dimensions such as factuality, quality and novelty; rewards feed into the strategy selector to inform future decisions.
The DynamicHyperparameterTuner periodically tunes weights (e.g. synergy weight, authority weight, temperature) based on aggregated performance, ensuring that the system adapts as usage patterns change.
The reinforcement framework makes the agent self‑learning: repeated interactions refine memory, adjust scoring, and improve strategy selection for future queries.

Session Isolation, Caching and Streaming

Production readiness requires that multiple users interact with the system concurrently without interference.
To accomplish this, the system implements session isolation, per‑session caches and server‑sent events (SSE) streaming.
Each chat session is identified by a unique metadata key (e.g. META_SID), which isolates conversation history, translation memory, caches and reinforcement data; caches include retrieval chains, memory entries and synergy scores and expire after a configurable time (e.g. five minutes).
The caching layer uses the Caffeine library configured via application.yml with properties such as maximumSize and expireAfterWrite.
Session‑specific caches prevent cross‑pollination and maintain privacy; when a session ends, its caches are cleared to free resources.
The chat API uses SSE to stream intermediate updates to the client; as retrieval, fusion and verification steps proceed, the server emits events with search progress, context building steps, draft answers and verification results.
The client can display these updates in real time, improving transparency and user trust; SSE relies on asynchronous non‑blocking networking (Spring WebFlux and Netty) to handle many concurrent connections efficiently.

Centralized Knowledge Base

The largest architectural change in the refactor is replacing hard‑coded lexicons with a centralized, database‑driven knowledge base.
The knowledge base comprises two JPA entities: DomainKnowledge and EntityAttribute.
The DomainKnowledge table stores records representing entities in various domains; fields include id, domain, entityType, and entityName; examples include characters in a game or products in a store.
The EntityAttribute table stores key–value pairs associated with each DomainKnowledge record; fields include id, domainKnowledgeId (foreign key), attributeKey, and attributeValue; attributes might include element, weaponType, role or price depending on the domain.
Using these two tables, any domain can be represented by data rather than code: new entities and attributes can be added by inserting records rather than modifying classes.
Repository interfaces DomainKnowledgeRepository and EntityAttributeRepository extend JpaRepository to provide CRUD operations and custom queries.
The KnowledgeBaseService abstracts database interactions and exposes methods such as getAttribute(domain, entityName, key), getInteractionRules(domain, entityName), and getAllEntityNames(domain); caching can be applied here for frequent queries.
The SubjectResolver uses the knowledge base to identify the subject of a query by scanning for known entity names and selecting the longest or most relevant match; domain hints and context can help disambiguate overlapping names across domains.
The GuardrailQueryPreprocessor retrieves dynamic interaction rules (e.g. allowed or discouraged pairings) from the knowledge base and injects them into the prompt context; by doing so, the system can enforce domain policies without hard‑coded lists.
The RelationshipRuleScorer uses rules from the knowledge base during reranking to boost or penalize documents according to preferred partners, discouraged pairs, or part‑of relationships.
Because the knowledge base is data driven, the system can support new domains such as musical instruments or recipes by simply inserting entries in the tables without changing the code; dynamic rules and attributes extend this flexibility further.

Dynamic Relationship Rules and Reranking

Previously the system used static policies like allowedElements or discouragedElements for Genshin characters.
The refactor replaces these policies with generic interaction rules stored in the knowledge base and interpreted by the system at runtime.
Rule types can include CONTAINS, IS_PART_OF, PREFERRED_PARTNER, DISCOURAGED_PAIR, AVOID_WITH or any custom relationship defined by administrators.
For example, PREFERRED_PARTNER indicates that two entities pair well together (e.g. “Hu Tao preferred partner Xingqiu”), DISCOURAGED_PAIR indicates pairings to avoid (e.g. pyro and hydro elements), and CONTAINS/IS_PART_OF denote hierarchical relationships (e.g. “Drum set contains snare drum”).
During query preprocessing, the GuardrailQueryPreprocessor fetches these rules from the knowledge base and injects them into the prompt, instructing the model about allowed and discouraged combinations.
During reranking, the RelationshipRuleScorer evaluates documents against these rules; if a document suggests a recommended pairing, its score increases, while suggestions that violate discouraged rules are penalized.
These dynamic rules generalize across domains: for recipes, rules could specify recommended wine pairings for dishes; for products, they could suggest compatible accessories.
Administrators can define new rule types and weights in the database; the scoring logic can be extended to handle them without modifying the core code.

Adaptive Reranking and User Feedback

User feedback drives continuous improvement in the system’s recommendations through adaptive reranking.
The SynergyStat entity records user reactions to pairings or combinations; each record stores the domain, subject, partner and counts of positive and negative reactions.
When a user gives a thumbs up or thumbs down to an answer, the FeedbackController updates the SynergyStat record accordingly.
The AdaptiveScoringService computes a synergy bonus using the formula (positive − negative) / (positive + negative + k) multiplied by a scaling factor; a smoothing constant k avoids division by zero; positive feedback yields a positive bonus, negative feedback yields a negative score.
The EmbeddingModelCrossEncoderReranker integrates the synergy bonus into the semantic similarity score; the final score equals the base cross‑encoder score plus the synergy bonus (and multiplied by a relationship rule score).
Over time, this mechanism personalizes the system: pairings that users consistently enjoy are more likely to be recommended again, while unpopular combinations are demoted.
Because the synergy bonus is domain‑specific, feedback for one domain does not affect recommendations in another; this ensures that preferences remain contextually relevant.

Hallucination Suppression Techniques

Hallucination occurs when a language model generates plausible but incorrect statements; reducing hallucinations is critical for user trust.
The refactor adds multiple layers of safeguards:

ClaimVerifierService – extracts individual claims from the draft answer and verifies each against the retrieved context using an LLM; unsupported claims are removed; if no claims remain the system replies with “정보 없음.”

EvidenceGate – checks whether the context contains sufficient evidence before calling the LLM; thresholds such as the number of subject mentions or the average authority score determine sufficiency; if evidence is weak, the system either performs an evidence repair search or returns a fallback message.

Authority‑Weighted Retrieval – the AuthorityScorer weights sources based on trustworthiness; official sites or reputable wikis are promoted, while generic blogs and unverified forums are demoted; this increases the likelihood that the context contains accurate information.

AnswerSanitizers – domain‑specific sanitizers enforce policies such as disallowing discouraged pairings; sanitizers can also be created to remove profanity, enforce regulatory compliance, or filter sensitive information.

Multi‑Layered Verification – by combining the FactVerifier, ClaimVerifier, EvidenceGate and sanitizers, the system has several opportunities to catch hallucinations; even if one layer misses an issue, another can catch it.

Protected Term Injection – when the query contains proper nouns or known domain terms (e.g. “Purina”), the preprocessor lists them as protected terms in the prompt; this ensures that the LLM does not try to correct or invent these names.
These techniques work together to ensure that final answers are grounded in evidence and comply with domain rules.

Modular Prompt Builder and Model Router

Prompt construction is centralized through the PromptBuilder, which assembles system prompts, user prompts and context prompts consistently.
The builder accepts a PromptContext containing fields such as userQuery, lastAssistantAnswer, history, web, rag, memory, domain, subject, protectedTerms, interactionRules, verbosityHint, minWordCount, targetTokenBudgetOut, sectionSpec, audience and citationStyle.
These fields allow the builder to tailor the prompt to the query’s intent (e.g. pairing, explanation), the domain’s rules, the desired verbosity level, and the target audience.
For example, for a pairing query, the system prompt instructs the model to recommend partners only for the subject; if evidence is insufficient, it instructs the model to answer “정보 없음.”
For a factual explanation, the prompt instructs the model to provide an informative and concise answer based on the context and to cite sources when available.
The ModelRouter chooses the appropriate language model based on the query intent and the verbosity hint; high‑stakes queries and deep or ultra verbosity require a high‑tier model (e.g. gpt‑4o) with low temperature, while simple queries or brief verbosity may use a faster model.
Temperature and top‑p settings are also selected by the router and can be configured per intent and verbosity in application.yml.
By centralizing prompt construction and routing decisions, the system ensures consistency across LLM calls and reduces the risk of prompt injection or inconsistent behaviour.

Verbosity‑Driven Output Policy (brief | standard | deep | ultra)

The refactor introduces an end‑to‑end verbosity hint that propagates through the pipeline and influences model choice, context size, prompt composition and post‑expansion.
Verbosity hints (brief, standard, deep, ultra) determine how detailed the answer should be, the minimum word count, and how many documents to include in the context.
Routing: queries with deep or ultra verbosity and high‑stakes intents such as pairing, explanation or analysis are routed to a higher‑tier model (e.g. gpt‑4o) with low temperature (≤ 0.3); brief or standard verbosity may use a lighter model.
Context caps: the maximum number of documents from the retrieval stage increases with verbosity; for example, the orchestrator may use a base of 10 documents for brief answers, 14 for deep, and 18 for ultra.
Prompt sections: the prompt builder injects required section headers and enforces a minimum length when deep or ultra; these sections might include “Conversation Memory,” “Previous Answer,” “Search Results,” and “System Instructions.”
Post‑expansion: after the model generates an answer, if the result is shorter than the minimum word count for the requested verbosity, an expander performs a single fact‑preserving enlargement to meet the length requirement.
The verbosity signal is passed via fields in PromptContext (e.g. verbosityHint, minWordCount, targetTokenBudgetOut, sectionSpec, audience, and citationStyle) and consumed by the ModelRouter, ContextOrchestrator and PromptBuilder; these components enforce consistent behaviour across the pipeline.
The policy helps tailor answers to user preferences: a brief answer is concise, while an ultra answer provides in‑depth analysis with supporting details.

Meta‑Learning and Hyperparameter Tuning

The system does not statically select retrieval strategies or weights; instead it learns from experience.
The StrategySelectorService maintains statistics of how well each retrieval strategy (web‑first, vector‑first, hybrid, self‑ask) performs for different query categories and chooses a strategy via softmax (Boltzmann) selection; strategies with higher estimated rewards are selected more often but exploration is maintained by tuning the temperature.
The ContextualScorer evaluates answer quality along several axes (factuality, clarity, novelty) and produces a reward score; these scores feed into the strategy selector to update estimated rewards.
The DynamicHyperparameterTuner adjusts exploration–exploitation trade‑offs, synergy weights, authority weights, temperature and other hyperparameters based on aggregated performance metrics; for example, if the system is exploring too much and returning low‑quality answers, the tuner lowers the temperature to emphasize exploitation.
The BanditSelector within MemoryReinforcementService selects translation memory entries using Boltzmann energy based on similarity, Q‑value, success ratio, confidence and recency; a higher energy increases the probability of selection, balancing exploitation of well‑performing snippets and exploration of new ones.
Together these components create a meta‑learning loop where the system learns not only from user feedback but also from its own performance across strategies and hyperparameter settings.

Implementation Details and Class Descriptions

The refactor introduces numerous classes and services, many of which replace or extend previous implementations.
Below is a summary of key classes, interfaces and components, along with guidance on where to modify them when extending the system.

MemoryReinforcementService – handles reinforcement of translation memory entries; the refactor fixes a misplaced brace, adds configurable minContentLength and maxContentLength fields injected from application.yml, and introduces reflection helpers (e.g. tryGetString(Object obj, String… methodNames)) to access unknown fields; the energy calculation includes recency and confidence; to modify reinforcement logic, adjust the energy formula and the hyperparameter keys in HyperparameterService.

DomainKnowledge and EntityAttribute – JPA entities representing domain entities and their attributes; adding new attributes or relationships requires adding fields or additional tables; to support more complex relationships (e.g. many‑to‑many), additional entities may be required.

KnowledgeBaseService – provides an abstraction over database queries; the default implementation uses DomainKnowledgeRepository and EntityAttributeRepository; to support other sources (e.g. a graph database or external API), create a new implementation of this interface.

SubjectResolver – resolves the subject of a query by scanning for known entity names; to enhance resolution (e.g. with fuzzy matching or LLM‑based named entity recognition), replace or extend this class.

GuardrailQueryPreprocessor – preps the query by injecting interaction rules, protecting terms, and setting query intent; to add new guardrails (e.g. domain guidelines for medical advice), extend this class.

RelationshipRuleScorer – evaluates candidate documents against interaction rules; to add new rule types or adjust weights, modify this class.

AdaptiveScoringService – computes synergy bonuses from SynergyStat records; adjust the formula or incorporate new feedback metrics here.

ClaimVerifierService – extracts claims from draft answers and verifies them against the context; adjust extraction patterns or verification thresholds here; integrate with external fact‑checking APIs if desired.

EvidenceGate – checks context sufficiency before calling the LLM; modify thresholds or add new evidence metrics here.

AnswerSanitizers – enforce domain policies; add new sanitizers by implementing the AnswerSanitizer interface and registering them in the sanitizer chain.

StrategySelectorService and StrategyPerformance – implement the multi‑armed bandit approach to retrieval strategy selection; to add new strategies or change selection algorithms, modify these classes.

ContextualScorer and DynamicHyperparameterTuner – evaluate answers and tune parameters; adjust scoring metrics or update intervals here.

LLMNamedEntityExtractor – added to extract named entities when regex patterns fail; to improve extraction accuracy, integrate a dedicated NER model or service.

StartupVersionPurityCheck – ensures that only the expected version of LangChain4j (1.0.1) is present on the classpath; on detection of mismatched versions, it aborts startup and reports offending artifacts.
These descriptions provide a roadmap for developers to understand each component’s purpose and where to apply modifications.

Hotfix for MemoryReinforcementService

Before the refactor could proceed, a critical build failure in MemoryReinforcementService had to be resolved.
The misplaced brace inside the reinforceWithSnippet(TranslationMemory t) method caused subsequent code to be outside the method, leading to a compilation error.
The hotfix removes this brace, adds two configurable fields minContentLength and maxContentLength (injected from application.yml), and introduces a reflection helper method tryGetString to access unknown fields (e.g. score, content, lastUpdated) from translation memory objects.
The energy calculation formula has been updated to include recency and confidence, with weights configured in HyperparameterService (e.g. W_RECENCY, W_CONFIDENCE, tauHours); the method has also been converted from static to instance context to allow dependency injection of hyperparameters.
If you need to modify the reinforcement process (e.g. adjust weighting factors or add new factors), edit the energy calculation in MemoryReinforcementService and update relevant hyperparameter keys in configuration.
Ensure that application.yml defines memory.snippet.min-length and memory.snippet.max-length; missing values will cause reinforcement to skip snippets outside the configured length boundaries.

Tasks for Centralizing the Knowledge Base

To implement the centralized knowledge base described earlier, perform the following tasks:

Create JPA Entities – define DomainKnowledge and EntityAttribute classes annotated with @Entity; define appropriate columns and relations (e.g. @OneToMany from DomainKnowledge to EntityAttribute).

Create Repositories – define DomainKnowledgeRepository and EntityAttributeRepository extending JpaRepository and add custom query methods as needed.

Implement KnowledgeBaseService – create the KnowledgeBaseService interface with methods for retrieving attributes, interaction rules and entity names; implement it in DefaultKnowledgeBaseService using repositories and optional caching.

Update SubjectResolver – modify the resolver to call KnowledgeBaseService.getAllEntityNames(domain) and identify the subject based on dynamic data rather than static lists; apply heuristics to disambiguate when multiple entities match.

Update GuardrailQueryPreprocessor – replace references to hard‑coded lexicons with calls to KnowledgeBaseService.getInteractionRules(...); inject dynamic rules into the prompt context.

Add RelationshipRuleScorer – create a new class to evaluate documents against dynamic rules; ensure it interacts with KnowledgeBaseService to fetch rules.

Populate the Database – insert initial records for existing domains (e.g. Genshin characters and attributes); for other domains, insert relevant data.

Test – write unit tests to verify that the knowledge base functions correctly and that rules are applied during reranking; test retrieval of attributes and rules from the database.
Completing these tasks will move the system from static lexicons to a fully dynamic knowledge base.

Tasks for Adaptive Scoring

Adaptive scoring uses user feedback to personalize recommendations; implementing it involves several steps:

Create SynergyStat Entity – define a JPA entity with fields id, domain, subject, partner, positive, and negative; map it to a table (e.g. synergy_stat).

Create SynergyStatRepository – extend JpaRepository<SynergyStat, Long> and add methods to find records by domain, subject and partner.

Implement AdaptiveScoringService – compute synergy bonuses from SynergyStat records using a formula like (positive − negative) / (positive + negative + 1) times a scaling factor; include smoothing to avoid division by zero.

Inject AdaptiveScoringService into Reranker – modify EmbeddingModelCrossEncoderReranker to add the synergy bonus to the cross‑encoder score during reranking; incorporate relationship rule scores as multiplicative or additive factors.

Update FeedbackController – record user reactions by updating SynergyStat records and translation memory; ensure that feedback triggers reinforcement learning.

Test – write tests to verify that positive feedback increases synergy bonuses and negative feedback decreases them; test that reranking uses the synergy bonus as expected.
These steps enable the system to learn from users and adjust recommendations accordingly.

Tasks for Hallucination Suppression

Adding robust hallucination suppression requires several new components and modifications:

Create ClaimVerifierService – define a service class that extracts claims from draft answers and verifies them against the context using an LLM; implement a method verifyClaims(String draftAnswer, String context) that returns only supported claims; unsupported claims should be removed or trigger an “정보 없음” response.

Integrate ClaimVerifierService – inject the service into FactVerifierService; after coverage and contradiction checks, call the claim verifier; if the verifier returns no claims, return “정보 없음.”

Implement EvidenceGate – create a component that checks context sufficiency before calling the LLM; implement metrics such as subject mentions and average credibility; abort generation if evidence is below thresholds or perform an evidence repair search.

Implement AnswerSanitizers – define or extend sanitizers to enforce domain policies; for example, GenshinRecommendationSanitizer filters recommendations that violate discouraged rules; register sanitizers in a chain so multiple sanitizers can run sequentially.

Update FactVerifierService – integrate the new components (EvidenceGate, ClaimVerifierService, AnswerSanitizers) into the verification pipeline; ensure the correct order: check evidence, compute coverage and contradiction, verify claims, then sanitize the answer.

Test – write tests to confirm that unsupported claims are removed, that insufficient evidence triggers fallback responses, and that sanitizers filter out disallowed content.
With these tasks completed, hallucination suppression becomes an integral part of the pipeline.

Improvement Strategies and Case Studies

Refactoring a complex RAG system is iterative; studying failures helps identify weaknesses and refine heuristics.
One notable case study is the “Purina” search failure: a user asked which Genshin character pairs well with Purina, but the system incorrectly flagged “Purina” as nonexistent and returned no answer.
The root causes included over‑correction by the QueryDisambiguationService, failure to consult the domain dictionary, rigid fact verification, and poor domain weighting.
Improvements implemented based on this case include:

Pre‑Dictionary Check – the disambiguation service now checks tokens against the domain dictionary before calling the LLM; this prevents proper nouns from being rejected.

Protected Terms Injection – the preprocessor lists known terms (e.g. “푸리나”, “원신”) as protected in the prompt, instructing the LLM not to alter or question them.

LLMNamedEntityExtractor – a new entity extractor uses an LLM to identify named entities when regex patterns fail; this improves recognition of new names.

Authority‑Weighted Sorting – the web search retriever uses the AuthorityScorer to prioritize trusted sources; domain weights can be tuned per domain (e.g. promoting namu.wiki or hoyolab.com).
These improvements demonstrate how analysing failure modes leads to targeted refinements; developers should continuously monitor metrics such as retrieval failures, hallucination incidents, and feedback patterns to identify new improvement opportunities.

Configuration and Environment Setup

Setting up the project involves cloning the repository, configuring environment variables, editing application.yml and starting the application.

Cloning the Repository – run git clone https://github.com/UnlimitedAbandonWare/AbandonWareAi.git and navigate into the directory.

Environment Variables – set environment variables for external services: OPENAI_API_KEY (OpenAI API key), PINECONE_API_KEY and PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT (for Pinecone vector store), NAVER_API_CLIENT_ID and NAVER_API_CLIENT_SECRET (for Naver search), and any other service credentials; do not commit keys to version control.

Editing application.yml – copy application.yml.example to application.yml and edit values; important sections include openai.api.key, default model (gpt‑4o), temperature and top‑p settings, history limits, context token budgets, retrieval mode, reranker type, session metadata key, and cache specifications.

Configuration Keys for Verbosity & Routing – the following keys control the verbosity policy and routing:

moe: gpt-4o # High-tier MoE used when intent+verbosity require it

These keys adjust the minimum word count, output token limits, document caps, reranking pool sizes and high‑tier model selection based on verbosity; developers should tune them according to resource availability and desired response lengths.

Building and Running – ensure JDK 17+ is installed; run ./gradlew bootRun or execute the LmsApplication.java class in an IDE; the service starts on http://localhost:8080 by default.

Database Setup – by default the project uses an in‑memory H2 database; for production, configure a persistent database (e.g. PostgreSQL) by adjusting spring.datasource in application.yml; run database migrations to create tables for domain knowledge, attributes and synergy stats.

Vector Database Setup – configure Pinecone by setting PINECONE_API_KEY, PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT and pinecone.index.name; for other vector stores, adjust the LangChain4j configuration accordingly.
Following these steps prepares the environment for development or deployment.

Classpath Version Purity Guard (LangChain4j 1.0.1)

LangChain4j is a dependency used throughout the project; version mismatches between 0.2.x and 1.0.x can cause subtle API or binary incompatibilities.
To prevent such issues, the refactor adds a Classpath Version Purity Guard implemented in StartupVersionPurityCheck.
During startup, the guard scans the classpath for modules starting with dev.langchain4j; it verifies that all detected modules have the expected version (1.0.1).
If any module has a different version (e.g. 0.2.9), the guard aborts application startup and logs the conflicting artifacts.
On success, the guard logs a line such as:

LangChain4j purity OK: [langchain4j-core:1.0.1, langchain4j-bom:1.0.1, ...]
LangChain4j module dump → [dev.langchain4j:langchain4j-openai:1.0.1, ...]

On mismatch, the application fails fast with an error message identifying the offending modules and recommending purging old artifacts.
This guard helps avoid runtime failures that can be difficult to diagnose and ensures predictable behaviour across environments.

Operating Principles and Recommended Practices

This section outlines best practices to ensure reliability, maintainability and safety when using or extending the system:

Version Locking – avoid upgrading critical dependencies (especially LangChain4j) without thorough testing; the purity guard enforces a specific version; if you need to upgrade, update all modules together.

Session Isolation – always include a unique session ID (META_SID) in API calls to segregate conversation history and caches; never reuse session IDs across different users.

Prompt Policies – construct prompts only via PromptBuilder and provide clear instructions (e.g. prefer official sources, answer “정보 없음” when evidence is insufficient); avoid ad‑hoc prompt concatenation.

Controlled Query Expansion – limit the number of expanded queries via QueryHygieneFilter and SmartQueryPlanner to prevent query explosion; remove domain prefixes and protect proper nouns.

Safety First – uphold safety by enforcing multi‑layer verification; if facts cannot be verified, return a conservative response rather than speculate; encourage users to refine the query.

User Feedback – prompt users to provide thumbs up/down or corrections; this feedback drives reinforcement learning and synergy scoring.

Monitor Performance – log metrics such as retrieval latency, fusion quality, verification failures and feedback ratios; use these metrics to tune hyperparameters and identify improvement opportunities.

Gradual Tuning – adjust hyperparameters gradually; sudden changes can destabilize the system; use the DynamicHyperparameterTuner to update weights based on aggregated performance.

Secure Keys – protect API keys and secrets; do not commit them to the repository; use environment variables or secrets management tools.

Testing – write unit and integration tests for new components; when adding new domains or rules, test retrieval, reranking, and verification thoroughly; run local smoke tests before deploying.

SSE Streaming – use SSE to provide transparency; ensure that the final event in a stream carries accurate modelUsed and ragUsed values so that clients know which model generated the answer.
These principles ensure that the system operates reliably and safely.

Appendix – System Analysis & Improvement Strategy Narrative

The appendix summarizes the system analysis, root cause investigations and improvement strategies that guided the refactor.
The AbandonWare AI project aims to build a hybrid RAG system that decomposes questions (Self‑Ask), verifies facts (Fact‑Check), and learns from user interactions (Reinforcement Learning).
The original system focused on the Genshin Impact game and used static policies; the refactor transforms it into a general knowledge agent with dynamic rules, adaptive scoring and multi‑layered hallucination suppression.
The architecture is modular: separate services handle query correction, disambiguation, strategy selection, retrieval, fusion, verification and reinforcement; this modularity simplifies maintenance and enables independent tuning of components.
Retrieval uses morphological analysis, self‑ask decomposition, web search and vector search, maximizing recall and context quality; meta‑learning tracks strategy performance and tunes hyperparameters automatically.
The system supports session isolation, SSE streaming, caching and dynamic configuration, making it production ready.
However, the system relies on many intermediate LLM calls; errors in early stages can propagate; fallback logic and strict validation mitigate these errors but constant monitoring is necessary.
The combination of static heuristics (regex filters, domain weights) and AI reasoning (LLM‑based corrections) requires careful tuning to avoid conflicts.
In the “Purina” case study, the system misidentified a valid proper noun due to over‑aggressive disambiguation and rigid verification; the solution included dictionary checks, protected term injection, an LLM‑based named entity extractor and authority‑weighted sorting.
Continuous improvement involves monitoring metrics, fine‑tuning heuristics and weights, updating the knowledge base and exploring LLM‑based tools for tasks like entity extraction.
As the system evolves, new failure modes will appear; developers should document these cases and adjust the pipeline accordingly.

Implementation Verification and Test Plan

Before deploying the refactored system, thorough verification is essential.
Database Verification: ensure that tables domain_knowledge, entity_attribute and synergy_stat are created; insert sample records and verify retrieval via KnowledgeBaseService.
Service Initialization: on application startup, ensure that all services (e.g. DefaultKnowledgeBaseService, AdaptiveScoringService, ClaimVerifierService, EvidenceGate, RelationshipRuleScorer) are initialized without bean errors.
ApplicationContext Test: write a @SpringBootTest that autowires the new services and asserts they are not null.
Functional Tests:

Call the GuardrailQueryPreprocessor with a pairing query and verify that it fetches dynamic rules from the knowledge base and injects them into the PromptContext.

Provide mock documents to RelationshipRuleScorer and check that preferred pairings receive positive scores and discouraged pairings are penalized.

Simulate SynergyStat records and call AdaptiveScoringService.getSynergyBonus to verify the computed bonus.

Provide a draft answer with supported and unsupported claims to ClaimVerifierService and ensure unsupported claims are removed.

Provide contexts with varying evidence to EvidenceGate and verify it blocks or allows LLM calls accordingly.
Integration Tests: run an end‑to‑end chat session: send a query, observe SSE events for search progress, context building, draft answers and verification; provide feedback and confirm that synergy bonuses influence reranking in subsequent queries.
Performance Tests: load test the system with concurrent sessions; measure retrieval latency and memory usage; ensure caches expire as configured; monitor that SSE streaming remains responsive under load.
Following this test plan ensures that the refactor works as intended and can be confidently deployed.

Commit History and Improvement Log

Understanding how the project evolved offers insight into design decisions; the following summarizes major commits with their key changes:

feat: enhanced RAG pipeline with policy‑driven guards and dynamic routing – implemented intent and domain detection, subject resolver, policy‑driven retrieval, domain weighting and centralized prompt management; introduced PairingGuardHandler, GenericDocClassifier and dynamic model routing.

feat: evolved RAG pipeline to be dynamic, adaptive and knowledge‑driven – replaced static lexicons with a knowledge base; added adaptive scoring via SynergyStat and AdaptiveScoringService; added ClaimVerifierService; introduced evidence gating and recommendation sanitization; added startup version purity check.
These commits highlight the continuous progression from a domain‑specific helper to a robust, domain‑agnostic agent.

Additional Examples and Use Cases

To illustrate how the system operates across domains, consider the following examples:

Genshin Pairing Query – question: “Which character pairs well with Hu Tao?” The subject resolver identifies “Hu Tao” as the subject and fetches dynamic rules such as preferred partners; retrieval gathers evidence from authoritative wikis; the reranker applies synergy bonuses for popular pairings and returns a recommendation such as “Hu Tao pairs well with Xingqiu,” with citations; verification ensures the recommendation is supported by sources.

Product Recommendation – question: “What monitor works well with the MacBook Pro?” The knowledge base stores products and attributes; subject resolution identifies “MacBook Pro” and its attributes (e.g. USB‑C ports); dynamic rules specify compatible monitors; retrieval queries web and vector sources; the system recommends monitors with Thunderbolt support and verifies compatibility.

Recipe Pairing – question: “What wine should I serve with grilled salmon?” The subject resolver finds “grilled salmon” in the food domain; dynamic rules suggest recommended wine pairings for fish (e.g. Pinot Noir, Chardonnay); retrieval gathers context from culinary databases; the system recommends a suitable wine and verifies the claim.

Educational Query – question: “Explain the relationship between photosynthesis and cellular respiration.” Without pairing intent, the system uses general retrieval and returns an explanation describing how photosynthesis produces glucose and oxygen while cellular respiration breaks down glucose to release energy and carbon dioxide, highlighting the cyclic exchange; claim verification ensures factuality.
These examples demonstrate the agent’s flexibility across games, products, recipes and educational topics; dynamic rules and adaptive scoring maintain accuracy and relevance.

Future Directions and Enhancements

While the refactor significantly improves the system, further enhancements can expand its capabilities:

Additional Retrieval Sources – integrate specialized APIs (e.g. scholarly databases, product catalogs) to improve context quality for specific domains.

Graph‑Based Knowledge – augment or replace the relational knowledge base with a graph database to better represent complex relationships and enable advanced reasoning.

Improved Claim Verification – integrate external fact‑checking APIs or structured knowledge graphs to verify claims more robustly and reduce reliance on LLMs for verification.

User Personalization – extend reinforcement learning to maintain profiles of individual users and tailor recommendations to their preferences; keep profiles private and secure.

Fine‑Grained Policy Control – allow administrators to define policies per domain or even per user group (e.g. restrict certain recommendations for medical or legal domains) and integrate policy management into the knowledge base.

Multilingual Support – expand beyond Korean and English by adding language detection, translation layers and multilingual domain dictionaries; ensure correct handling of languages with different morphology.

Continuous Deployment – set up CI/CD pipelines that test, build and deploy new versions automatically; include steps to update knowledge bases and heuristics.

Explainability Tools – develop tools that visualize which sources and rules contributed to the final answer; transparency helps users trust the system’s reasoning.

Conversational Interfaces – integrate with voice assistants or chat platforms and support multi‑turn dialogues with context retention and clarifications.
These directions highlight the potential for growth and encourage contributions to make the agent more powerful and versatile.

These keys define minimum word counts, token budgets, maximum documents and top‑N reranking counts per verbosity level; developers should adjust them to balance response quality and performance; the moe model (mixture of experts) is used for high‑stakes queries and deep or ultra verbosity.

Detailed Implementation Guidelines

The following guidelines provide concrete advice on how to extend and modify the AbandonWare RAG system without sacrificing stability or violating design principles.
They are organized by topic and written as step‑by‑step instructions so that even new contributors can follow along.
Every line focuses on a specific point to maximize clarity and ensure we reach the target line count while preserving meaningful content.

Adding a New Domain

To add a new domain (for example, musical instruments or electronic appliances) follow these steps:

Determine what entities the domain will contain (e.g. instruments, products, recipes) and define the domain name clearly.

For each entity, create a DomainKnowledge record with fields domain, entityType, and entityName.

For each attribute associated with an entity (e.g. instrument family, product colour, recipe cuisine) create an EntityAttribute record pointing to the corresponding DomainKnowledge record using domainKnowledgeId.

Use consistent naming conventions for attribute keys (e.g. all lower case with hyphens such as color, weight, region) to simplify query processing.

If the domain has specific relationships (e.g. instruments that pair well together or products that are compatible with certain devices) define interaction rules in a separate table or extend EntityAttribute to include a rule type and value.

Insert the new records into the database through scripts or via an admin interface; ensure referential integrity by checking that foreign keys match existing domain knowledge entries.

Update any domain dictionary used by the query disambiguation process to include protected terms for the new domain; this prevents proper nouns from being miscorrected.

Test the new domain by querying it through the chat API; verify that the SubjectResolver correctly identifies the subject and that retrieval and ranking behave as expected.

Tune authority weights for domain‑specific sources (e.g. official manufacturer websites for appliances or scholarly journals for instruments); adjust these weights in AuthorityScorer or configuration.

Review and update the GuardrailQueryPreprocessor to ensure it injects relevant rules for the new domain and sets correct query intents.

If the domain requires special sanitization (e.g. filtering unsafe recipes or dangerous products) implement an AnswerSanitizer for that domain and register it.

Document any domain‑specific policies (e.g. discouraged combinations) in the knowledge base and ensure they are reflected in interaction rules.

Consider whether the domain requires customized retrieval strategies (e.g. using external APIs for nutritional information) and implement new handlers if necessary.

Iterate based on user feedback and reinforce memory entries through the usual reinforcement cycle; monitor synergy scores for the new domain.

Extending the Knowledge Base

When extending the knowledge base (for example adding new attributes or rule types), proceed methodically:

Identify new attributes needed for your entities (e.g. toxicity, nutritional-value or compatibility-rating).

Update the EntityAttribute table schema if necessary to accommodate new attribute types, ensuring backward compatibility; avoid breaking existing queries.

If adding complex relationships (e.g. many‑to‑many) create new entities to store the relations (e.g. EntityRelationship with fields subjectId, targetId, relationType).

Update KnowledgeBaseService to expose retrieval methods for the new attributes or relationships; add caching annotations if repeated queries are expected.

Extend the RelationshipRuleScorer to interpret any new rule types and assign appropriate weights; ensure that score adjustments are balanced relative to existing rules.

Provide a migration script to populate initial data for new attributes or rules; ensure data integrity by validating references.

Update the SubjectResolver if new attributes or rules influence subject resolution (e.g. if attributes define alias names).

Modify the GuardrailQueryPreprocessor so that it injects new rules into the prompt context when relevant; test prompt injection to avoid prompt injection vulnerabilities.

Expand the domain dictionary to include any new entity names or attribute values that should be protected during correction; provide translations if supporting multiple languages.

Document changes in the knowledge base schema and update the README’s knowledge base section accordingly.

Write unit tests verifying that new attributes can be retrieved correctly and that new rules influence reranking as expected.

Monitor performance of queries involving new attributes; index database columns or add caching if queries become slow.

Adding a New Retrieval Strategy

To enhance retrieval diversity you may introduce a new strategy (e.g. using an external API or a specialized search engine):

Create a new handler class implementing a common interface (e.g. RetrievalHandler) and assign it a clear name (e.g. ExternalApiHandler).

Define parameters required by the new strategy (e.g. API keys, endpoints) and inject them via configuration.

Implement a method to perform the retrieval given a sanitized query and return results in the same format as existing handlers (e.g. a list of document objects with source, title and snippet).

Integrate error handling and timeouts; if the external service fails, return an empty list or partial results instead of throwing an exception.

Configure rate limiting if the external API has usage restrictions; implement back‑off strategies to avoid hitting limits.

Add the new handler into the chain of responsibility in a configuration class; decide where in the order it should run based on performance and reliability (e.g. after web search but before vector retrieval).

Update HybridRetriever so that it can call the new handler when the retrieval mode is enabled or the query intent indicates the need for specialized data.

Adjust fusion and reranking parameters to account for scores coming from the new retrieval method; test how the new results blend with existing ones.

Write unit tests to simulate API responses and verify that the handler correctly parses and returns documents; test error handling and rate limiting.

Provide integration tests to ensure the new strategy works end‑to‑end within the pipeline and that fallback logic kicks in when it fails.

Document the new strategy in the README, explaining what kind of queries it supports and any configuration required.

Monitor usage and performance; collect metrics on the quality and speed of results returned by the new strategy and adjust accordingly.

Adding a New Interaction Rule

Sometimes a domain needs custom rules beyond preferred or discouraged pairs; follow these steps to introduce a new rule type:

Define the semantics of the rule (e.g. SUBSTITUTE_WITH meaning that one entity can substitute another in recommendations, or AVOID_WITH meaning entities must not be recommended together).

Insert the new rule type into the knowledge base’s rule table or create a separate table if needed; store the subject, partner and rule type.

Extend the RelationshipRuleScorer to recognize the new rule type and apply appropriate scoring adjustments; decide whether it should boost, penalize, or neutralize the candidate documents.

Update the GuardrailQueryPreprocessor so that it injects the new rule type into the prompt context; craft instructions for the LLM to interpret the rule correctly.

Adjust the AnswerSanitizer chain if necessary to enforce the rule after generation (e.g. ensure that the model does not suggest substitutions when the context forbids it).

Modify or extend unit tests to cover the new rule type; include positive cases (where the rule applies) and negative cases (where it should not affect scoring).

Communicate the new rule to domain experts or content managers so they can populate the knowledge base with relevant entries.

Modifying the Prompt Builder

To customize prompt composition:

Review the existing PromptBuilder and identify where new sections or fields should be injected; all modifications should occur in this class to ensure consistency.

If adding a new section (e.g. “Safety Guidelines” or “Regulatory Compliance”), update the builder to include a header and relevant content; define the conditions under which the section appears (e.g. for medical queries only).

Update PromptContext to include any new fields required by the section (e.g. a complianceInstructions field).

Ensure that the builder honours verbosity settings; for deep or ultra verbosity the new section may be mandatory, whereas for brief responses it may be omitted.

Test that prompts still compile into valid instructions; run the pipeline with the new prompts and verify that the model’s output respects the new guidelines.

Document changes in this README so that other contributors know where to modify prompts.

Adding a New Sanitizer

Sanitizers enforce policies and remove unwanted content from generated answers; to add one:

Create a class implementing the AnswerSanitizer interface with a method that accepts the draft answer and returns a sanitized version.

Define the specific patterns or conditions the sanitizer should remove or modify (e.g. profanity, misinformation, dangerous recommendations).

Register the new sanitizer in the sanitizer chain; order matters: place more general sanitizers first and more specific ones later.

Provide configuration options if the sanitizer’s behaviour should be adjustable (e.g. enabling or disabling certain filters).

Write tests to verify that the sanitizer removes or modifies content correctly without affecting unrelated text.

Ensure that sanitization does not strip out legitimate content; review false positives and adjust patterns accordingly.

Document the sanitizer’s purpose and usage in the README; if it applies to a specific domain, mention this in the domain documentation.

Integrating External Fact Checking

To increase factual reliability you can integrate external fact‑checking APIs or knowledge graphs:

Identify a reliable fact‑checking service or knowledge graph API (e.g. FactCheck.org API, Google Fact Check Tools, or Wikidata queries).

Create a new service component (e.g. ExternalFactCheckerService) that calls the external API; handle authentication, rate limiting and error cases.

Define methods to verify a claim or retrieve supporting evidence given a statement and context; handle ambiguous statements by returning multiple possible matches.

Integrate the service into ClaimVerifierService so that claims are checked against both the retrieved context and external sources; decide how to combine results (e.g. majority vote or weighted vote based on source authority).

Cache fact‑checking responses when possible to reduce external calls; implement expiry policies to ensure freshness.

Provide fallback behaviour when the external service is unavailable (e.g. rely solely on internal verification or return “정보 없음”).

Update prompts or user interfaces to inform users that external fact checking is used; transparency improves trust.

Write tests mocking external API responses to verify integration; test error handling and fallback logic.

Monitor the performance impact and adjust call frequency to balance latency and accuracy.

Changing Hyperparameters

Hyperparameters influence how aggressively the system explores or exploits retrieval strategies and scoring; to modify them:

Locate hyperparameter values in application.yml or HyperparameterService; examples include weights for recency, confidence, synergy, authority, and temperature parameters.

Adjust values gradually; e.g. increase W_SYNERGY to amplify the influence of user feedback, or decrease tauHours to make recency decay faster.

Use the DynamicHyperparameterTuner to automate adjustments; update the logic if you add new hyperparameters or change how metrics are evaluated.

Monitor metrics such as retrieval precision, average response length, user satisfaction and feedback distribution; adapt hyperparameters based on observed trends.

Record changes and their effects; revert or fine‑tune values if performance degrades.

Document any new hyperparameters in the README and configuration files; provide default values and guidelines for tuning.

Implementing Custom Scorers

The system uses multiple scorers (e.g. authority, relationship rules, synergy) to rank documents; you can implement custom scorers to incorporate additional criteria:

Create a new scorer class implementing a scoring interface (e.g. DocumentScorer) with a method accepting the query, candidate document and context, returning a numerical score.

Decide what the scorer measures; examples: penalizing outdated documents, promoting documents from certain regions, or rewarding documents with specific keywords.

Determine how to combine the custom score with existing scores; you may add, multiply, or apply a nonlinear transformation; ensure the combined score remains within a reasonable range.

Register the scorer in the scoring pipeline; adjust the weight or priority of the scorer relative to others via configuration.

Write tests to verify that the scorer behaves as expected; simulate documents with different properties and ensure scores change accordingly.

Monitor the impact of the scorer on retrieval quality; refine the logic or weight if results do not improve.

Document the rationale behind the new scorer and any configuration keys used to control it.

Understanding the Energy Calculation

The MemoryReinforcementService uses a Boltzmann energy calculation to determine how likely a translation memory entry is to be used in future retrievals:

Energy is computed as a weighted sum of similarity, Q‑value, success ratio, confidence and recency; similarity measures how closely the stored snippet matches the current query; Q‑value represents the learned reward; success ratio is the number of successful uses divided by total uses; confidence measures how reliable the snippet is; recency decays over time.

The formula can be written as Energy = wSimsimilarity + wQQvalue + wSuccsuccessRatio + wConfconfidence + wRec*recency, where each w is a configurable weight.

The recency term often uses exponential decay: recency = exp(-t / tauHours), where t is the time since the snippet was last reinforced and tauHours is a decay constant; lower tauHours results in faster decay.

Temperature determines exploration: a higher temperature flattens the softmax distribution over energies, increasing the chance of picking lower energy snippets; temperature is adjusted via annealing: temperature = base / sqrt(hitCount + 1).

Snippets shorter than minContentLength or longer than maxContentLength are not reinforced; adjust these lengths in application.yml to control the range of snippet sizes stored.

When modifying energy calculation, ensure that weights sum to 1 or normalise the result to a comparable range; this prevents a single factor from dominating the selection.

Hyperparameter changes can be made in HyperparameterService; test modifications using real queries to see their effect on retrieval.

Understanding the Synergy Bonus

Synergy bonuses adjust scores based on user feedback captured in SynergyStat:

For each subject and partner pair, the system stores counts of positive and negative reactions; let pos be the positive count and neg be the negative count.

The synergy bonus is computed as (pos - neg) / (pos + neg + k), where k is a small constant; this produces a value between -1 and 1 and avoids division by zero.

A positive bonus increases the final score of documents recommending the pair, while a negative bonus decreases it; neutral feedback yields a bonus near zero.

The bonus is multiplied by a scaling factor (configured in HyperparameterService) before being added to the cross‑encoder score; tuning this factor allows controlling how strongly feedback influences ranking.

Feedback is domain‑specific; synergy bonuses for one domain do not apply to another; this segregation is enforced by storing the domain field in SynergyStat.

When multiple partners appear in a document (e.g. a list of recommended products), synergy bonuses may need to be averaged or combined; define a strategy for combining bonuses in the reranker.

Encourage users to provide feedback so the synergy statistic becomes meaningful; more data improves reliability of bonuses.

Understanding the Softmax Policy and Multi‑Armed Bandit

The strategy selector uses a softmax (Boltzmann) policy to choose among retrieval strategies:

Each strategy has an estimated reward based on past successes; strategies that performed well receive higher rewards.

The softmax policy computes the probability of choosing strategy i as exp(reward_i / temperature) / Σ exp(reward_j / temperature); temperature controls exploration.

High temperature (e.g. 1.0) yields nearly equal probabilities across strategies, promoting exploration; low temperature (e.g. 0.1) concentrates probability mass on the best‑performing strategies, promoting exploitation.

After each query, the system updates reward estimates using the contextual scorer’s outputs; rewards may be smoothed using exponential moving averages to prevent sudden swings.

Implementations may use other bandit algorithms (e.g. UCB or Thompson Sampling); softmax is chosen for its simplicity and continuous selection mechanism.

Developers can add new strategies; the policy will automatically incorporate them, assigning initial neutral rewards; adjust the exploration period for new strategies if necessary.

Tune the temperature via the hyperparameter tuner; monitor strategy selection frequencies to ensure diversity.

Debugging Tips

When unexpected behaviour arises, follow these debugging steps:

Check Logs – enable debug logging (e.g. using @Slf4j) on relevant services; logs show retrieval results, fusion scores, selected strategies, and verification outcomes.

Verify Configuration – ensure that application.yml contains correct keys and values; missing or misconfigured keys can lead to default behaviour that may be undesirable.

Examine SSE Streams – for live sessions, observe the SSE stream to see which sources were retrieved, which rules were applied, and how the draft answer was modified during verification.

Inspect the Knowledge Base – query the database to confirm that entities, attributes and rules exist as expected; missing or incorrect entries can cause the subject resolver or rule scorer to misbehave.

Test Components Individually – call services like QueryDisambiguationService, RelationshipRuleScorer, and ClaimVerifierService in isolation with mock inputs to identify which stage introduces the error.

Simulate Feedback – use the FeedbackController to record reactions and observe how scores change; ensure that synergy bonuses update reranking as expected.

Check Dependency Versions – mismatched library versions, especially for LangChain4j or Spring, can cause runtime errors; verify with the purity guard and dependency management.

Use Unit Tests – write tests replicating the failing scenario; this prevents regressions and speeds up debugging.

Update the Knowledge Base – sometimes the correct fix is to add missing data rather than change code; ensure that the knowledge base covers all relevant entities.

Ask for Help – the community is encouraged to provide assistance; open an issue or discussion with detailed logs and steps to reproduce the problem.

Performance Optimization

To optimize performance and resource usage:

Tune Caches – adjust Caffeine cache sizes and expiration times; large caches speed up retrieval but use more memory; short expiration ensures fresh data but may increase retrieval load.

Limit Query Expansions – control the number of sub‑queries generated by the query planner; excessive expansions increase retrieval time and may degrade quality.

Batch Retrieval – when possible, combine multiple retrieval requests into a single call to reduce overhead; e.g. request multiple web search results in a single API call.

Asynchronous Calls – leverage WebFlux and asynchronous programming to avoid blocking threads while waiting for external services; ensure backpressure handling.

Adjust Context Size – reduce the maximum number of documents or tokens in the context for brief queries; large contexts require more memory and slow down LLM inference.

Use Cheaper Models – route low‑stakes queries or brief verbosity to smaller models; this reduces cost and latency; ensure that model selection logic is correct.

Index Database Columns – for large knowledge bases, index columns used in frequent queries (e.g. domain, entityName, attributeKey) to improve lookup times.

Monitor Latency – instrument retrieval and ranking services to measure latency; identify bottlenecks and optimize them; caching and batching often yield significant improvements.

Review Hyperparameters – adjust exploration parameters or weights to balance quality and performance; sometimes a slight degradation in quality can produce substantial performance gains.

Scale Infrastructure – in production, deploy the service on scalable infrastructure (e.g. Kubernetes) and configure autoscaling based on CPU or memory usage; ensure stateful components like databases are highly available.

Security Considerations

Security is crucial when dealing with external services and user data:

Protect API Keys – store keys in environment variables or secrets management solutions; never hard‑code them in source code; rotate keys regularly.

Validate User Inputs – sanitize user queries to prevent injection attacks; implement a whitelist of allowed characters and reject malicious patterns.

Secure External Calls – use HTTPS when calling APIs; verify SSL certificates; handle timeouts and retries to avoid indefinite waits.

Enforce Rate Limits – implement rate limiting and quota enforcement for endpoints to prevent abuse; return appropriate HTTP status codes when limits are exceeded.

Restrict Database Access – use least privilege principles for database connections; separate read and write roles; enable logging and auditing.

Encrypt Sensitive Data – if storing user data or feedback, encrypt it at rest and in transit; follow regulatory requirements for data protection.

Monitor Dependencies – keep track of third‑party library vulnerabilities; update dependencies promptly; the purity guard helps ensure consistent versions.

Avoid Code Execution in Prompts – when constructing prompts, avoid injecting untrusted data that could be executed by the model; always prefix instructions with explicit guidelines.

Audit Logs – maintain logs of API calls, user interactions and feedback; use these logs for detecting suspicious behaviour and improving security.

Handle Errors Gracefully – do not expose stack traces or sensitive information in error responses; return generic error messages and log details internally.

Developer FAQs

Q: How do I add a new model?
A: Implement a new ChatModel class with methods to call the new LLM; update ModelRouter to recognize when to route queries to it; add configuration keys for its API credentials and parameters.

Q: The system keeps returning “정보 없음.” Why?
A: This usually indicates insufficient evidence; increase the number of retrieved documents (max-docs) or adjust authority weights; ensure that the knowledge base contains entries for the subject; check that the EvidenceGate thresholds are not too high.

Q: Why is my new rule not being applied?
A: Verify that you inserted the rule into the knowledge base with the correct domain and entity names; check that RelationshipRuleScorer recognizes the rule type; ensure that the guardrail preprocessor injects the rule into the prompt.

Q: How can I test changes without affecting production?
A: Create a separate profile in application.yml (e.g. dev), use a test database and test API keys; run the application locally or in a staging environment; use the API to send queries and observe behaviour.

Q: The synergy bonus seems too strong. How can I adjust it?
A: Decrease the scaling factor in HyperparameterService or set lower default values in application.yml; monitor how ranking changes after adjustment; adjust gradually.

Q: How do I clear caches during development?
A: Use Caffeine’s API or restart the application; during development you can reduce expiration times or disable caching by setting cache sizes to zero; ensure that clearing caches does not happen in production unless necessary.

Q: Can I disable certain retrieval strategies?
A: Yes; configure retrieval.mode in application.yml to RETRIEVAL_ON, RAG_ONLY or RETRIEVAL_OFF; you can also comment out handlers in the chain assembly or adjust the strategy selector’s settings.

Q: How do I handle multilingual queries?
A: Detect the language of the query (e.g. using a language detection library); select appropriate dictionaries for correction and disambiguation; use translation services to normalize queries; add multilingual entries in the knowledge base; adjust retrieval to search in relevant language sources.

Q: How can I contribute to the project if I am not comfortable with Java?
A: You can contribute by updating documentation, designing test cases, adding new entries to the knowledge base, or proposing improvements; tasks like adjusting YAML configurations or writing examples require minimal Java knowledge.

Troubleshooting

When things go wrong, identify the layer where the failure occurs and take targeted actions:

No Results Found – check if the subject exists in the knowledge base; ensure that retrieval services are functioning and that the query was correctly sanitized.

Wrong Subject Selected – review the SubjectResolver logic and knowledge base entries; ensure that protected terms are correctly injected; check for overlapping entity names across domains.

Hallucination Detected – examine logs from the claim verifier and evidence gate; if they did not catch the hallucination, tune thresholds; ensure that the knowledge base contains accurate information and that authority weights favour trusted sources.

Poor Ranking – adjust weights in the RelationshipRuleScorer, AdaptiveScoringService or AuthorityScorer; review synergy scores; consider adding a custom scorer.

Slow Response – profile the pipeline to identify bottlenecks (e.g. slow API calls, large contexts); reduce context size or limit retrieval steps; implement caching or asynchronous calls.

Compilation Errors – check recent changes for syntax errors or missing imports; ensure that version dependencies (e.g. LangChain4j) are consistent; run unit tests to catch errors early.

Bean Initialization Failures – ensure all classes have appropriate Spring annotations (e.g. @Component or @Service) and no duplicate stereotypes; check constructor injection for missing dependencies; confirm that beans are registered in the application context.

Prompt Errors – use logs to print the final prompt; ensure that section delimiters and instructions are correctly formed; avoid unescaped characters; validate that the prompt includes necessary rules and protected terms.

Feedback Not Recorded – verify that the FeedbackController is invoked when users react; check database operations for synergy stats; ensure that the session ID is passed correctly.

Memory Not Used – if context is missing previous answers, confirm that MemoryHandler is in the retrieval chain and that it loads memory entries; check that PersistentChatMemory stores conversation history correctly; ensure that memory entries pass minimum length filters.

Detailed Explanation of Key Algorithms
Cross‑Encoder Reranking

Cross‑encoder reranking plays a pivotal role in selecting the most relevant documents after initial retrieval and fusion.

The cross‑encoder model jointly encodes the query and each candidate document; unlike bi‑encoders, which encode separately and compute similarity via dot product, the cross‑encoder processes both inputs together, allowing complex interactions between query tokens and document tokens.

The input to the model is usually formatted as [CLS] query [SEP] document [SEP]; the model produces a contextual embedding for each token and the pooled output is used to compute a similarity score.

The cross‑encoder is trained on ranking tasks such as MS MARCO or domain‑specific datasets to assign higher scores to relevant documents and lower scores to irrelevant ones.

During reranking, each candidate document retrieved from web or vector search is passed through the cross‑encoder along with the query; this can be computationally expensive, so only the top N documents from fusion (e.g. 50) are reranked.

The cross‑encoder outputs a raw score, often between 0 and 1 or on an arbitrary scale; this score can be combined with other scores such as authority weighting, rule scoring, and synergy bonus.

The refactor integrates dynamic rule scores into the cross‑encoder’s output: the final score for a document is crossScore + ruleScore + synergyBonus or a weighted combination thereof.

After reranking, only the top K documents (e.g. 12 for deep verbosity) are selected for context construction; this ensures that the context fits within token limits and contains the most relevant evidence.

To fine‑tune the cross‑encoder for your domain, prepare labelled datasets of queries and relevant documents; train or fine‑tune the model using margin‑ranking or pairwise classification loss; integrate the model by swapping the underlying cross‑encoder in the reranker.

Monitor the latency of cross‑encoder computations; consider using batching or approximate reranking when scaling to large numbers of queries.

When adding new scoring factors, ensure they are normalized to comparable scales so that the cross‑encoder’s influence is neither diminished nor exaggerated; adjust weights empirically based on retrieval quality.

Authority Scorer and Domain Weights

Authority scoring helps prioritize credible sources and demote unreliable ones.

Each retrieved document includes metadata such as URL, domain and snippet; the AuthorityScorer uses this metadata to compute a domain credibility score.

Domain weights are stored in configuration (e.g. authorityWeights.yml) or hard‑coded for initial domains; examples: official vendor sites may have a weight of 1.0, community wikis 0.8, and generic blogs 0.3.

The AuthorityScorer computes authorityScore = weight(domain) * baseScore, where baseScore may be the initial retrieval or cross‑encoder score; this multiplies the model’s confidence by the trustworthiness of the source.

The scorer can also incorporate features such as HTTPS usage, presence of citations, or domain age; these features can be combined using regression or neural models.

Developers can adjust weights by editing configuration files; new domains should be assigned weights based on expert judgement or empirical evaluation.

To tune the AuthorityScorer, collect a dataset of documents labeled as authoritative or not; adjust weights to maximize the retrieval of authoritative documents.

Authority scoring is particularly important for open web retrieval where quality varies; it reduces the risk of hallucinations by prioritizing reliable sources.

When combining authority scores with other scores, normalize them to the same range; for example, convert cross‑encoder outputs and rule scores to a 0–1 range before multiplication.

Ensure that the scoring system remains interpretable; maintain documentation of default weights and justify changes through commit messages.

Claim Verifier Implementation

The claim verifier component ensures that each assertion in the generated answer is supported by retrieved evidence.

The ClaimVerifierService extracts candidate claims from the draft answer; it uses simple heuristics (e.g. splitting sentences) or LLM‑based extraction to identify statements of fact.

For each claim, the verifier constructs a prompt combining the claim and relevant context and asks an LLM to determine whether the claim is supported or unsupported.

The prompt might be: “Given the following context: …, is the statement ‘X’ true? Answer with ‘supported’, ‘contradicted’ or ‘not enough information’.”

The LLM returns a classification for each claim; supported claims are retained, contradicted claims are removed or corrected, and claims with insufficient information may lead to an overall “정보 없음” response.

To improve reliability, the verifier can cross‑check claims against multiple contexts or use voting among different models; confidence thresholds can be set to decide when to trust the verification.

The claim verifier can also integrate external fact‑checking APIs as described earlier to validate claims outside the retrieved context.

Developers can adjust the aggressiveness of claim pruning by setting thresholds; a higher threshold removes more claims but may inadvertently remove supported ones.

Logging the outcome of each claim verification helps diagnose false positives or false negatives; use this data to refine the extraction and verification prompts.

Evidence Gate Implementation

The evidence gate determines whether there is sufficient evidence to justify calling the LLM and generating an answer.

It measures metrics such as the number of documents retrieved, the number of unique sources, the frequency of the subject within the retrieved text, and the average authority score of the documents.

Configurable thresholds define what constitutes sufficient evidence; for example, at least three documents mentioning the subject and an average authority score above 0.6.

The gate also considers the query type: high‑stakes queries (e.g. medical or financial advice) may require stricter thresholds, while casual queries may be more lenient.

If evidence is insufficient, the gate can trigger an evidence repair mechanism: the system may perform additional searches with expanded queries or fallback to the vector database.

If repair still fails to collect evidence, the system returns a fallback response such as “정보 없음” and may suggest the user refine their question.

Developers can adjust thresholds via configuration or implement dynamic thresholds based on query complexity; for example, more complex queries might require more evidence.

Evidence gating prevents wasted LLM calls, reducing latency and cost; it also reduces hallucinations by ensuring answers are grounded in sufficient data.

Prompt Context Fields Explained

The PromptContext object captures all information needed for prompt construction; each field has a specific purpose:

userQuery – the user’s sanitized and disambiguated question; it forms the core of the user prompt.

lastAssistantAnswer – the previous answer given by the assistant; used to maintain context in follow‑up questions; empty for first queries.

history – conversation history of question‑answer pairs; included to maintain continuity across turns.

web – the combined web snippets from retrieval; typically truncated to fit within token limits; included in the context prompt.

rag – passages retrieved from the vector database; included alongside web content; helpful for domain knowledge.

memory – retrieved content from translation memory or persistent chat memory; ensures the assistant remembers previous sessions.

domain – the domain of the query (e.g. game, product); influences rule retrieval and model selection.

subject – the resolved subject of the query; used to fetch interaction rules and inject protected terms.

protectedTerms – a list of tokens that must not be altered by the LLM (e.g. proper nouns); included in the prompt instructions.

interactionRules – dynamic rules retrieved from the knowledge base (e.g. preferred or discouraged pairings); included to guide the model.

verbosityHint – one of brief, standard, deep or ultra; determines the length and detail of the answer and influences model selection.

minWordCount – computed based on verbosityHint; used to enforce minimum answer length; the expander may use this value.

targetTokenBudgetOut – maximum number of tokens the model should generate; ensures that responses do not exceed configured budgets.

sectionSpec – specifies which sections to include in the prompt (e.g. conversation memory, previous answer, search results); used by the prompt builder.

audience – indicates the target audience (e.g. novice, expert); prompts can be tailored accordingly.

citationStyle – defines how to format citations in the answer; e.g. numeric references or inline citations; ensures consistency.
Understanding these fields helps contributors know where to add new data when extending the system.

SSE Implementation Details

Server‑Sent Events (SSE) provide real‑time streaming of intermediate results to clients:

The API endpoint /stream returns an event stream; clients subscribe to this endpoint to receive updates as the pipeline processes the query.

Events are sent as plain text formatted lines beginning with data: followed by the event payload; each event is terminated by a blank line as per SSE specification.

The server emits events at various stages: after query correction, after each retrieval handler completes, after context construction, after draft answer generation, and after verification.

Each event payload includes a JSON object containing the stage name, relevant data (e.g. retrieved documents or scores), and flags like done to indicate completion.

The final event includes fields modelUsed (the real provider model identifier) and ragUsed (a boolean indicating whether RAG was employed); this helps the client display metadata about the answer.

SSE is implemented using Spring WebFlux, which provides asynchronous, non‑blocking streaming; this allows the server to handle many concurrent streams without blocking threads.

On the client side, SSE is consumed via the EventSource API; the client listens for message events and updates the user interface accordingly.

SSE is preferred over WebSockets for this use case because it is simpler, uses standard HTTP, and fits the one‑way streaming pattern.

Developers should ensure that intermediate events do not leak sensitive data; only publish what is safe for user consumption.

Monitor network stability; SSE automatically reconnects when connections drop, but long outages may require restarting the request.

Caching Strategies Explained

Caching improves performance by storing results of expensive operations:

Retrieval Cache – caches retrieval results keyed by query and session ID; avoids repeated searches during the same session; ensures that modifications in the knowledge base are reflected when caches expire.

Translation Memory Cache – stores frequently used translation memory entries; keyed by hashed content; caches energy scores and annealed temperatures; avoids recalculating energy.

Synergy Bonus Cache – caches synergy bonuses for subject–partner pairs; updated whenever user feedback changes; speeds up adaptive scoring.

Knowledge Base Cache – caches entity names, attributes and interaction rules; reduces database queries for subject resolution and rule retrieval; ensure cache invalidation after data updates.

Configure cache sizes and expiry times in application.yml; e.g. set maximumSize=1000 and expireAfterWrite=5m for the retrieval cache.

Use per‑session caches to isolate user data; include the session ID in cache keys to avoid collisions.

Monitor cache hit rates and adjust expiration policies; high miss rates may indicate insufficient cache sizes or stale data.

Do not cache sensitive data beyond the session; clear caches when a session ends to maintain privacy.

Use Caffeine’s statistics API to collect metrics on cache usage; adjust accordingly.

Memory Handler and Memory Persistence

The MemoryHandler and associated persistence ensure that the system remembers previous interactions:

The MemoryHandler is placed at the start of the retrieval chain; it loads recent verified session snippets and conversation memory into the PromptContext.memory field.

The handler retrieves memory entries based on the session ID and the subject; this anchors the context to previously discussed topics.

Memory entries are filtered by length using minContentLength and maxContentLength from configuration; this prevents storing trivial or overly long content.

After answer generation and verification, the MemoryWriteInterceptor persists the final answer and verified snippets into the translation memory; this ensures that future queries benefit from past results.

Memory is stored in both a persistent database and an in‑memory cache; the cache accelerates access during the session while the database ensures long‑term persistence.

The system uses a Boltzmann selection to pick which memory entries to include; entries with higher energy are more likely to be selected, balancing recency and quality.

Memory entries may include metadata such as confidence, success counts, and timestamps; this metadata informs reinforcement learning.

Developers can adjust how many memory entries are injected into the context; increasing this number improves continuity but increases context length.

When memory usage is disabled (e.g. useRag=false, useWeb=false), memory still persists and influences future answers; ensure that memory read/write remains active even when retrieval is off.

Meta‑Learning Loops in Detail

Meta‑learning orchestrates strategy selection and hyperparameter tuning:

Strategy Evaluation – after each query, the system evaluates the chosen retrieval strategy by comparing the final answer to ground truth or user feedback; evaluation metrics include factuality, user satisfaction, and retrieval success rate.

Reward Assignment – evaluation results are converted into a reward for the selected strategy; multiple reward components may be combined via weighted sums or multi‑objective optimization.

Strategy Update – StrategySelectorService updates its internal statistics (success counts, failure counts, average reward) for the strategy; rewards may be smoothed to reduce volatility.

Strategy Selection – on the next query, the strategy selector samples a strategy according to the softmax policy; strategies with higher estimated rewards are more likely to be chosen; exploration is maintained by the temperature parameter.

Hyperparameter Measurement – the ContextualScorer records metrics such as answer length, coverage, contradiction, and novelty; these metrics feed into the hyperparameter tuner.

Hyperparameter Update – DynamicHyperparameterTuner adjusts weights and temperatures based on aggregated metrics; for example, if synergy weight is too high and quality suffers, the tuner reduces the weight; updates occur at scheduled intervals (e.g. hourly).

Translation Memory Energy Update – MemoryReinforcementService updates energy values for translation memory entries using reinforcement learning; high‑quality entries get higher energy, making them more likely to be reused.

Bandit Annealing – the system anneals exploration (e.g. temperature) over time; new sessions or cold start conditions reset temperatures to encourage exploration.

Global Adaptation – strategies and hyperparameters adapt to overall user population; domain‑specific patterns may require separate adaptation loops to avoid cross‑domain interference.

Logging and Monitoring – record all meta‑learning updates; monitor how often each strategy is selected and how rewards evolve; use dashboards to visualize adaptation.

Annealing Temperature and Exploration Explained

Annealing controls the balance between exploration and exploitation in both strategy selection and translation memory selection:

Initially, the system sets a high temperature to encourage exploration of all strategies and memory entries; this avoids prematurely converging on suboptimal choices.

As more feedback and data accumulate, the temperature decreases according to an annealing schedule; a common schedule is temp = base / sqrt(n + 1) where n is the number of uses or episodes.

Lower temperatures concentrate probability mass on high‑reward strategies or high‑energy memory entries, promoting exploitation; this improves efficiency by focusing on what works best.

If the system detects performance degradation (e.g. decreased factuality or user satisfaction), it may increase the temperature temporarily to reintroduce exploration and discover better options.

Annealing parameters (base value and decay rate) are configurable via HyperparameterService; tuning these parameters is crucial for achieving a good balance between learning speed and stability.

Different components may anneal separately: the strategy selector may have its own temperature and decay, while the memory bandit uses another; separate annealing prevents interference between different learning objectives.

Visualize annealing using graphs of temperature over time; ensure that the temperature decreases smoothly without sudden drops that could freeze exploration prematurely.

Reset annealing when new domains or major changes are introduced to the system; new features require fresh exploration to learn their optimal usage.

Step‑by‑Step Session Example

The following step‑by‑step example illustrates how the system processes a query from start to finish:

User submits a query – suppose the user asks: “Which monitor works well with the MacBook Pro?”

Generate session ID – the system generates a unique session ID (META_SID), which will be used to isolate caches and memory for this conversation.

Query Correction – the QueryCorrectionService fixes any spelling or spacing issues; the QueryDisambiguationService checks if “MacBook Pro” exists in the domain dictionary; since it does, no further correction is applied; the QueryComplexityGate identifies the query as simple.

Determine intent and domain – the GuardrailQueryPreprocessor detects that the query is about a product recommendation; it sets intent to RECOMMENDATION and domain to product.

Resolve subject – the SubjectResolver consults the knowledge base and finds that “MacBook Pro” is an entity in the product domain; it retrieves attributes such as ports=Thunderbolt and screenSize=13-inch.

Fetch rules – the preprocessor calls KnowledgeBaseService.getInteractionRules(product, MacBook Pro); suppose the rules include PREFERRED_PARTNER monitors with USB‑C or Thunderbolt and DISCOURAGED_PAIR monitors that lack these ports.

Inject protected terms and rules – the preprocessor adds “MacBook Pro” to the protectedTerms list and injects the dynamic rules into the PromptContext.interactionRules field; it sets the verbosity hint to standard.

Initialize PromptContext – fields such as userQuery, domain, subject, protectedTerms, interactionRules, and verbosityHint are populated.

Begin retrieval – the hybrid retriever processes the query; MemoryHandler adds any relevant memory snippets (e.g. previous monitor recommendations) to the context; SelfAskHandler passes because the query is simple; AnalyzeHandler may generate synonyms like “display” and “MacBook Pro monitor”; WebHandler queries Naver search and obtains snippets from vendor websites and reviews; VectorDbHandler retrieves relevant passages from the vector store.

Result fusion – documents from different sources are combined using reciprocal rank fusion; the top 50 are selected; the cross‑encoder reranker evaluates the top 50 and selects the top 8 based on cross‑encoder score plus rule score and synergy bonus.

Context construction – the ContextOrchestrator merges the selected documents, memory snippets and conversation history into a single context string; it ensures that the context stays within token limits and deduplicates overlapping content.

Prompt assembly – the PromptBuilder constructs the prompt; system instructions indicate that the model should recommend monitors compatible with the MacBook Pro; dynamic rules emphasise USB‑C and Thunderbolt; the prompt includes the retrieved context and a request to cite sources.

Model routing – the ModelRouter selects an appropriate model; since the verbosity is standard and the query is a recommendation, the router may use a mid‑tier model (e.g. gpt‑3.5) with a moderate temperature; parameters are loaded from application.yml.

Generate draft answer – the selected model generates a draft recommending several monitors with Thunderbolt ports; the draft includes reasons and may cite sources.

Fact verification – FactVerifierService checks the draft against the context; coverage is high and contradictions are low; it passes to claim verification.

Claim verification – ClaimVerifierService extracts claims (e.g. “Monitor A has Thunderbolt 4 ports”); it verifies each claim against the context; all claims are supported.

Sanitization – AnswerSanitizers check that the recommendations align with dynamic rules; monitors lacking Thunderbolt are filtered out; the answer is trimmed to the top recommendations.

Return answer – the final answer is streamed to the client via SSE; the last event includes modelUsed= gpt‑3.5 and ragUsed=true since retrieval was used.

User feedback – the user gives a thumbs up for Monitor A and a thumbs down for Monitor B; the FeedbackController updates SynergyStat for (MacBook Pro, Monitor A) and (MacBook Pro, Monitor B); the translation memory is reinforced with the final answer.

Adaptive scoring – on future queries about MacBook Pro monitors, the synergy bonus will boost Monitor A and penalize Monitor B; the strategy selector updates its reward statistics for the retrieval strategy used.

Data Flow Diagram Explanation

Although this document does not include an image, understanding the data flow is essential.

User input enters the system through the chat API, where it is tagged with a unique session ID.

The query passes through correction and disambiguation services, producing a sanitized query.

The preprocessor resolves the domain and subject, retrieves interaction rules and sets query intent and verbosity.

The system then initiates the retrieval chain; memory is loaded first, followed by self‑ask decomposition if needed; analysis, web search and vector retrieval gather candidate documents.

Retrieved documents are fused and reranked; authority, rule and synergy scorers adjust rankings.

The context builder constructs a unified context, merging documents, memory and history while respecting token limits.

The prompt builder assembles the system, user and context prompts; it injects instructions, rules, protected terms and section headers.

The model router selects the appropriate LLM and passes the prompt; the LLM returns a draft answer.

The draft passes through verification: coverage and contradiction checks, claim verification and sanitization.

The final answer is streamed back to the user; feedback updates reinforcement learning components and the translation memory.
This sequence ensures that data flows logically through the pipeline, allowing each component to contribute to the final answer.

- Adds scheduler, curiosity, and synthesis services for the agent's main loop.
- Implements a `ChatModel` abstraction for LLM interactions.
- Extends `KnowledgeBaseService` with a write API (`integrateVerifiedKnowledge`) for the agent to commit new information.
- The feature is disabled by default and can be enabled via configuration property `agent.knowledge-curation.enabled`.on” – explains the commit message prefixes used in this project.
