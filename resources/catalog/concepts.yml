# Sample concept catalog used by the Entity/Concept Generalization patch.
#
# Each entry defines a canonical concept together with a list of alternative
# spellings (aliases).  When a user query mentions any of the aliases the
# ConceptResolver will normalise it to the canonical concept.  Sites may
# optionally bias search towards authoritative sources.
