/**
 * Integration test skeleton for the dynamic retrieval handler chain.  In a
 * full implementation this test would verify that retrieval handlers are
 * executed in the correct order (SelfAsk → Analyze → Web → Vector) and
 * that partial failures do not reset accumulated results.  It would also
 * confirm that the chain stops early when a sufficient number of results
 * (topK) has been gathered.
 *
 * At present the underlying retrieval handlers are complex and rely on
 * external services.  To keep the test suite compiling without those
 * dependencies this test asserts a basic truth as a placeholder.  Future
 * contributors should implement mocks for the handler interfaces and
 * populate the assertions accordingly.
