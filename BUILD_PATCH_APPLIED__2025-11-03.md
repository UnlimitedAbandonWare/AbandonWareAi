# Build Fix Patch — src111_merge15
- Applied at: 2025-11-03T05:09:20Z
- Summary:
  - Rewrote Gradle scripts to valid Kotlin DSL (removed placeholder ellipses).
  - Switched app module to curated sources at `app/src/main/java_clean` and restricted includes to `com/example/lms/**`.
  - Kept `lms-core` (stable-only include) and `cfvm-raw` modules as-is.
  - Ensured Boot main class: `com.example.lms.AppApplication`.
  - Left functional stubs (Planner/RuleBreak/FinalSigmoid/DPP/Calibrator/Canonicalizer/ONNX gate/Single-Flight) in place under java_clean.
- Build guidance:
  - Run: `./gradlew :app:bootJar` (or `./gradlew build` for multi-module).
  - If you still see legacy compile errors, verify that `java_clean` is the only source path for app.
