# How to Merge the Agent into an Existing Service

This document provides high‑level guidance on merging the K‑CHAT agent module (`app` in this repository) into an existing Spring Boot service.  The aim is to integrate the tool/skill layer, consent management, durable jobs, orchestration, observability and context bridging without disrupting existing functionality.

## 1. Extract the Agent Module

The `app` directory contains a standalone Spring Boot application.  Copy the contents of this directory into your existing service under a new module (for example `agent-module`).  Ensure that the `build.gradle.kts` file is aligned with your build system and that the source folder structure (`src/main/java` and `src/main/resources`) matches your conventions.

## 2. Register Beans

Import the agent configuration into your main application context.  If you are using Java configuration, add the following to one of your `@Configuration` classes:

```java
@Import(com.abandonware.ai.agent.config.AgentConfiguration.class)
```

This will register the tool registry, consent service, job queue, orchestrator and stub integrations.  Alternatively, copy the bean declarations from `AgentConfiguration` into your own configuration class and customise them as needed.

## 3. Wire Endpoints


Example:

```java
@RestController
class AgentController {
  private final Orchestrator orchestrator;
  // inject ToolRegistry, ConsentService, etc.

  @PostMapping("/agent/ask")
  public ResponseEntity<?> ask(@RequestBody Map<String,Object> body, HttpSession session) {
    String sessionId = session.getId();
    ConsentToken token = new ConsentToken(sessionId);
    ToolContext ctx = new ToolContext(sessionId, token);
    try {
      Map<String,Object> result = orchestrator.runFlow("kakao_ask", body, ctx);
      return ResponseEntity.ok(result);
    } catch (ConsentRequiredException e) {
      // render consent card
    }
  }
}
```

## 4. Replace Stub Integrations

The provided implementations of `KakaoMessageService`, `N8nNotifier`, `KakaoPlacesClient`, `KakaoReverseGeocodingClient`, `HybridRetriever` and `TavilyWebSearchRetriever` are stubs that do not perform any real network I/O.  Replace these classes with your own clients that integrate with the respective external systems.  The method signatures are intentionally simple and should be straightforward to map to HTTP calls using `WebClient` or `RestTemplate`.

## 5. Persist Consent Grants and Jobs

In this sample, consent grants and jobs are stored in memory.  For a production deployment you should:

* Provide a `JobQueue` implementation that uses a durable queue (e.g. Redis, Kafka) to reliably store jobs.  The `DurableJobService` will work unchanged against any implementation of `JobQueue`.

## 6. Extend the Flow Definitions

Flow definitions reside in `src/main/resources/flows/`.  You can add new YAML files to declare additional flows.  The orchestrator will automatically load the appropriate file when `runFlow` is invoked.  Ensure that any new tools referenced in flows are registered in the `ToolRegistry` via the configuration.

## 7. Instrumentation

The classes in `com.abandonware.ai.agent.observability` provide a minimal tracing and metrics facility.  For real observability, integrate the agent with Micrometer and OpenTelemetry.  Replace `AgentTracer` and `AgentMetrics` with wrappers around these libraries and add appropriate exporters to your application.

By following the steps above you can incorporate the agent's capabilities into your existing service while maintaining clear separation between core business logic and AI orchestration.
