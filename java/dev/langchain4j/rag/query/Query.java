 * Lightweight replacement for the LangChain4j {@code Query} class that was
 * removed in version 1.0.x.  Several components in the LMS codebase still
 * reference the 0.x builder API (removed in later versions), as well as
 * constructors accepting a text and metadata pair.  To preserve backwards
 * compatibility without pulling in the obsolete 0.x artefacts, this class
 * re‑implements the minimal surface area required by the application.
 *
 * <p>The class stores a plain text query along with an arbitrary metadata
 * object.  The metadata type is intentionally declared as {@code Object} to
 * remain agnostic of the underlying representation used by upstream
 * libraries.  Consumers should treat the value as opaque and avoid casting
 * unless absolutely necessary.</p>
