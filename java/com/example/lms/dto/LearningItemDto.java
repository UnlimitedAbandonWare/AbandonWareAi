/**
 * A lightweight DTO representing a single learning example transmitted
 * from the client to the server.  Each learning item records the
 * user's question (q), the assistant's answer (a), a list of
 * supporting evidence (e.g. URLs) and a timestamp indicating when
 * the turn was completed.  These items are used when the client
 * opts into the client‑echo learning mode, allowing the server to
 * ingest verified conversations for future model fine‑tuning or
 * knowledge curation.
