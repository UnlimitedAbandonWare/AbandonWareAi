                - Do NOT invent characters/items/places that do not exist in the referenced domain (e.g., Genshin Impact).

                  DO NOT rewrite or append any notes. Keep the original query as rewrittenQuery and set confidence="high".
                - Do not append speculative notes such as "(존재하지 않는 요소 가능성)". Such notes are prohibited.
