/**
 * A gate controlling invocation of the expensive cross‑encoder reranker.
 *
 * <p>The hybrid retrieval pipeline collects a candidate list of documents
 * during the first pass.  While the cross‑encoder produces more accurate
 * rankings, it is computationally expensive and should only be invoked when
 * the candidate set is sufficiently uncertain.  This gate reads several
 * heuristics from the application configuration to decide whether or not to
 * perform reranking.  When the candidate list contains fewer than
 * {@code ceTopK} elements the marginal gain of reranking is low and the gate
 * returns {@code false}.  Additional heuristics based on uncertainty,
 * disagreement and margin are exposed via configuration but are not
 * implemented here.  They provide extension points for future work.</p>
