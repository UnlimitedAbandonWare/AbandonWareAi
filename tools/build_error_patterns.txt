# ---- AUTO: stuff3_missing_helpers ----
# Pattern: Gradle Java compile error for missing DomainWhitelist / HybridRetriever helper methods.
# Trigger when build log contains all of:
#   - "HybridRetriever.java"
#   - "DomainWhitelist.java"
#   - "error: cannot find symbol"
#   - one of: "extractUrl(String)", "extractHost(String)", "isCommunity(String)", "isBanned(String)"
# Suggested fix: implement extractUrl in HybridRetriever and helper methods (extractHost, isOfficial(host), isCommunity, isBanned) in DomainWhitelist.

# ---- AUTO: stuff3_unified_rag_orchestrator_lc4j_shim ----
# Pattern: Gradle Java compile error for UnifiedRagOrchestrator using legacy LangChain4j Query/metadata APIs.
# Trigger when build log contains all of:
#   - "UnifiedRagOrchestrator.java"
#   - "error: cannot find symbol"
#   - "Query.from(req.query)"
#   - "Map<ContentMetadata,Object> cannot be converted to Metadata"
# Suggested fix: update UnifiedRagOrchestrator to call `new Query(req.query)`, treat `Content.metadata()` as a Map, and add an slf4j `log` field.
