# AUTO BUILD PATCH NOTES —  Sanitizer & Guard Hardening
- Timestamp: 2025-11-04T10:42:31.751272Z

## Changes
1. **Hardened build error guard**
   - Updated `src/scripts/ci/build_error_guard.sh` and `scripts/ci/build_error_guard.sh` to:
     - Normalize encodings and line endings (UTF‑8/LF)
     - Strip zero‑width characters (U+200B/C/D, U+FEFF)
     - Remove any variant of the placeholder * / * (with/without brackets)
     - Redact emails, phones, AWS/GCP keys
     - Emit frequency summaries as `*.summary.txt` and `*.summary.json`

2. **Sanitized sources for placeholder leakage**
   - Removed `` markers from 26 files (110 replacements) including
     - `src/main/java/com/example/lms/fusion/GrandFusionModule.java`
     - docs / notes / pattern samples

3. **Extended internal error patterns**
   - Appended `STRIP__MARKER` rule to `src/.internal/build_error_patterns/patterns.json` (action: `sanitize/strip_marker`).

## Expected outcome
- CI no longer flags or propagates `` placeholder in sanitized logs.
- Reduced false positives in error miners and stable JSON summaries for dashboards.
- No behavior changes at runtime; only build/log tooling is affected.
